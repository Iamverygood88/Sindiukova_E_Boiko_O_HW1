         <h1>Little Story about Russian and Ukrainian girls</h1>
    		<h3>Story about Evgeniia Sindiukova (Russia)</h3>
    		<p>I was born near China. In the city which named Vladivostok. The road from my city to Moscow takes around eight hours by plane (or seven days by train). <br>Yes, my country is really big. I like Chinese food and borsh (it's a Russian soup). Interactive media design is my forth education.<br>I have a bachelor degree in Journalism but this major does not really suit me because I do not like to communicate with people, ask them questions and etc. <br>I moved to Canada because I like the education level here. I think it is really professional and I will know a lot of staff when I graduate. I have a blonde hair. <br>
